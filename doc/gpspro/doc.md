# GpsPro documentation

When navigating to GpsPro for the first time, you'll see a screen similar to this one:

</p>

This screen always shows the internal GPS first. Below are available bluetooth devices.
If your GPS device isn't listed, then you should first pair it from the bluetooth settings of your
Android device.

Please note that bluetooth must be enabled for this feature to work.

## GPS selection

To select a GPS device, simply tap the line of the device of your choice.

That's it. You can go back to the map selection, and select a map. TrekMe listens for location
updates coming from your GPS device. If you don't see any location updates, please ensure that your
GPS device is properly configured. If the issue remains, there might be connectivity issues with
TrekMe. See the troubleshooting section below.

## Troubleshooting

For investigation purposes, you can record your GPS device activity for a short period of time
(10 seconds).
You'll be asked to choose the location of the recording file, called "diagnosis". Please send me
that file by email at plr.devs@gmail.com - I'll investigate why TrekMe couldn't read locations and
make future releases compatible with your GPS.

This feature is accessible by tapping the settings icon at the end of the selected device line:
